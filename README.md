# IoT_Garden

this project is created with two things in mind: one is having a project that helps me growing my 
own food at home and the other one is having a project for my stream (https://www.twitch.tv/velas_code) 

the project consists in a dashboard for monitoring the status of the vegetables in the garden, adding 
new ones and starting the irrigation process accordingly.

This will run in a raspberry pi at my home but can be deployed to any hosting service that runs nodejs.
